# üß† Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning (ResNet50)

This project presents an automated system for classifying brain MRI images into four categories: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor** using a **ResNet50**-based deep learning model. The system aims to support radiologists and healthcare professionals in early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors.
